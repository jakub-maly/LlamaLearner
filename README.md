LLAMA learner: an interactive language learner.

Talk to your local baker in Italian and try to find the translations for five basic words! Ask questions in English and listen to the baker's replies in Italian. If you want to hear the baker, click the sound button.

Note: This is a demo version; the back-end supports both language and setting configurations!

(The model requires Ollama's `LLAMA2` model to be installed, as well as the Python libraries `PyQt6`, `translate`, `langchain`, and `gtts`).
